# Crossref API client for NodeJS in Typescript

Generated by [Knowledge Futures](https://www.knowledgefutures.org/) on behalf of the [Docmaps project](https://docmaps.knowledgefutures.org/).

## Generation

Use `pnpm generate` to create the latest code based on updates to `crossref-swagger.json`. Note that while the specification available
at [`https://api.crossref.org/swagger-docs`](https://api.crossref.org/swagger-docs) declares it is using Swagger 2.0 API, it turns out
that there are some syntax errors in that specification. I am looking for a more stable source, but at the moment, the [version of this
file committed to this repo](/crossref-swagger.json) has a few minor variations, namely adding specs for path parameters that were missing
and correcting the use of some arrays.
