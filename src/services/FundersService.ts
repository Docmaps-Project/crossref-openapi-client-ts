    /**
     * Returns list of works associated with the specified {id}.
     * ## Queries
     *
     * Free form search queries can be made, for example, works that include `renear` or `ontologies` (or both):
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /works?query=renear+ontologies
     * ```
     *
     *
     * ## Field Queries
     * Field queries allow for queries that match only particular fields of metadata. For example, this query matches records that contain the tokens `richard` or `feynman` (or both) in any author field:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /works?query.author=richard+feynman
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * Field queries can be combined with the general `query` parameter and each other. Each query parameter is ANDed with the others:
     *
     * ##
     * ```
     * /works?query.title=room+at+the+bottom&query.author=richard+feynman
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * This endpoint supports the following field queries:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * + `query.affiliation` - query contributor affiliations
     * + `query.author` - query author given and family names
     * + `query.bibliographic` - query bibliographic information, useful for citation look up, includes titles, authors, ISSNs and publication years
     * + `query.chair` - query chair given and family names
     * + `query.container-title` - query container title aka. publication name
     * + `query.contributor` - query author, editor, chair and translator given and family names
     * + `query.degree` - query degree

     * + `query.standards-body-name` - query standards body name
     * + `query.title` - query title
     * + `query.translator` - query translator given and family names
     * ## Sort
     *
     * Results can be sorted by applying the `sort` and `order` parameters. `sort` sets the field by which results will be sorted. `order` sets the result ordering, either `asc` or `desc` (default is `desc`).
     *
     * An example that sorts results in order of publication, beginning with the least recent:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /works?query=josiah+carberry&sort=published&order=asc
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * This endpoint supports sorting by the following elements:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * + `created` - sort by created date
     * + `deposited` - sort by time of most recent deposit
     * + `indexed` - sort by time of most recent index
     * + `is-referenced-by-count` - sort by number of times this DOI is referenced by other Crossref DOIs
     * + `issued` - sort by issued date (earliest known publication date)
     * + `published` - sort by publication date
     * + `published-online` - sort by online publication date
     * + `published-print` - sort by print publication date
     * + `references-count` - sort by number of references included in the references section of the document identified by this DOI
     * + `relevance` - sort by relevance score
     * + `score` - sort by relevance score
     * + `updated` - sort by date of most recent change to metadata, currently the same as deposited
     * ## Facets
     *
     * Facet counts can be retrieved by enabling faceting. Facets are enabled by providing facet field names along with a maximum number of returned term values. The larger the number of returned values, the longer the query will take. Some facet fields can accept a `*` as their maximum, which indicates that all values should be returned.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * For example, to get facet counts for all work types:
     *
     * ##
     * ```
     * /works?facet=type-name:*
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * This endpoint supports the following facets:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * + `affiliation` - author affiliation
     * + `archive` - archive location
     * + `assertion` - custom Crossmark assertion name
     * + `assertion-group` - custom Crossmark assertion group name
     * + `category-name` - category name of work
     * + `container-title` - [max value 100], work container title, such as journal title, or book title
     * + `funder-doi` - funder DOI
     * + `funder-name` - funder literal name as deposited alongside DOI
     * + `issn` - [max value 100], journal ISSN (any - print, electronic, link)
     * + `journal-issue` - journal issue number
     * + `journal-volume` - journal volume
     * + `license` - license URI of work
     * + `link-application` - intended application of the full text link
     * + `orcid` - [max value 100], contributor ORCID
     * + `published` - earliest year of publication
     * + `publisher-name` - publisher name of work
     * + `relation-type` - relation type described by work or described by another work with work as object
     * + `ror-id` - institution ROR ID
     * + `source` - source of the DOI
     * + `type-name` - work type name, such as journal-article or book-chapter
     * + `update-type` - significant update type
     * ## Filters
     *
     * Filters allow you to select items based on specific criteria. All filter results are lists.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * ##
     * ```
     * /works?filter=type:dataset
     * ```
     *
     * ### Multiple filters
     *
     * Multiple filters can be specified in a single query. In such a case, different filters will be applied with AND semantics, while specifying the same filter multiple times will result in OR semantics - that is, specifying the filters:
     *
     * - `is-update:true`
     * - `from-pub-date:2014-03-03`
     * - `funder:10.13039/100000001`
     * - `funder:10.13039/100000050`
     *
     * would locate documents that are updates, were published on or after 3rd March 2014 and were funded by either the National Science Foundation (`10.13039/100000001`) or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (`10.13039/100000050`). These filters would be specified by joining each filter together with a comma:
     *
     * ##
     * ```
     * /works?filter=is-update:true,from-pub-date:2014-03-03,funder:10.13039/100000001,funder:10.13039/100000050
     * ```
     *
     * ### Dot filters
     *
     * A filter with a dot in its name is special. The dot signifies that the filter will be applied to some other record type that is related to primary resource record type. For example, with work queries, one can filter on works that have an award, where the same award has a particular award number and award-giving funding agency:
     *
     * ##
     * ```
     * /works?filter=award.number:CBET-0756451,award.funder:10.13039/100000001
     * ```
     * ##
     *
     * Here we filter on works that have an award by the National Science Foundation that also has the award number `CBET-0756451`.
     *
     * ### Note on dates
     *
     * The dates in filters should always be of the form YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM or YYYY. The date filters are inclusive. For example:
     *
     * * `from-pub-date:2018-09-18` filters works published on or after 18th September 2018
     * * `from-created-date:2016-02-29,until-created-date:2016-02-29` filters works first deposited on 29th February 2016
     * * `until-created-date:2010-06` filters works first deposited in or before June 2010
     * * `from-update-date:2017,until-update-date:2017` filters works with metadata updated in 2017
     *
     * Also note that date information in Crossref metadata can often be incomplete. So, for example, a publisher may only include the year and month of publication for a journal article. For a monograph they might just include the year. In these cases the API selects the earliest possible date given the information provided. So, for instance, if the publisher only provided 2013-02 as the published date, then the date would be treated as 2013-02-01. Similarly, if the publisher only provided the year 2013 as the date, it would be treated at 2013-01-01.
     *
     * ### Note on owner prefixes
     *
     * The prefix of a Crossref DOI does **NOT** indicate who currently owns the DOI. It only reflects who originally registered the DOI. Crossref metadata has an **prefix** element that records the current owner of the Crossref DOI in question.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * Crossref also has member IDs for depositing organisations. A single member may control multiple owner prefixes, which in turn may control a number of DOIs. When looking at works published by a certain organisaton, member IDs and the member routes should be used.
     *
     * ### Notes on incremental metadata updates
     *
     * When using time filters to retrieve periodic, incremental metadata updates, the `from-index-date` filter should be used over `from-update-date`, `from-deposit-date`, `from-created-date` and `from-pub-date`. The timestamp that `from-index-date` filters on is guaranteed to be updated every time there is a change to metadata requiring a reindex.

     * ## Elements
     *
     * Crossref metadata records can be quite large. Sometimes you just want a few elements from the schema. You can \"select\" a subset of elements to return using the `select` parameter. This can make your API calls much more efficient. For example:
     *
     * ##
     * ```
     * /works?select=DOI,prefix,title
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * This endpoint supports selecting the following elements.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * + `DOI`
     * + `ISBN`
     * + `ISSN`
     * + `URL`
     * + `abstract`
     * + `accepted`
     * + `alternative-id`
     * + `approved`
     * + `archive`
     * + `article-number`
     * + `assertion`
     * + `author`
     * + `chair`
     * + `clinical-trial-number`
     * + `container-title`
     * + `content-created`
     * + `content-domain`
     * + `created`
     * + `degree`
     * + `deposited`
     * + `editor`
     * + `event`
     * + `funder`
     * + `group-title`
     * + `indexed`
     * + `is-referenced-by-count`
     * + `issn-type`
     * + `issue`
     * + `issued`
     * + `license`
     * + `link`
     * + `member`
     * + `original-title`
     * + `page`
     * + `posted`
     * + `prefix`
     * + `published`
     * + `published-online`
     * + `published-print`
     * + `publisher`
     * + `publisher-location`
     * + `reference`
     * + `references-count`
     * + `relation`
     * + `score`
     * + `short-container-title`
     * + `short-title`
     * + `standards-body`
     * + `subject`
     * + `subtitle`
     * + `title`
     * + `translator`
     * + `type`
     * + `update-policy`
     * + `update-to`
     * + `updated-by`
     * + `volume`
     * ## Pagination with offsets
     *
     * Offsets are an easy way to iterate over results sets up to 10,000 items. This limit applies to the sum of values of parameters `offset` + `rows`.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * The number of items returned in a single response is controlled by `rows` parameter (default is 20, and maximum is 1,000). To limit results to 5, for example, you could do the following:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /works?query=allen+renear&rows=5
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * `offset` parameter can be used to retrieve items starting from a specific index of the result list. For example, to select the second set of 5 results (i.e. results 6 through 10), you would do the following:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /works?query=allen+renear&rows=5&offset=5
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ## Deep paging
     *
     * Deep paging using cursors can be used to iterate over large result sets, without any limits on their size.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * To use deep paging make a query as normal, but include the `cursor` parameter with a value of `*`, for example:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /members/311/works?filter=type:journal-article&cursor=*
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * A `next-cursor` field will be provided in the JSON response. To get the next page of results, pass the value of `next-cursor` as the cursor parameter (remember to URL-encode). For example:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /members/311/works?filter=type:journal-article&cursor=<value of next-cursor parameter>
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * Clients should check the number of returned items. If the number of returned items is equal to the number of expected rows then the end of the result set has been reached. Using next-cursor beyond this point will result in responses with an empty items list.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ## Sample
     *
     * Being able to select random results is useful for both testing and sampling. You can use the `sample` parameter to retrieve random results. So, for example, the following selects 10 random works:
     *
     * ##
     * ```
     * /works?sample=10
     * ```
     * ##
     *

    /**
     * Returns a list of all funders in the [Funder Registry](https://gitlab.com/crossref/open_funder_registry).
     * ## Queries
     *
     * Free form search queries can be made, for example, funders that include `research` and `foundation`:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /funders?query=research+foundation
     * ```
     *
     *
     * ## Filters
     *
     * Filters allow you to select items based on specific criteria. All filter results are lists.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * ##
     * ```
     * /funders?filter=location:Spain
     * ```
     * ##
     *
     * This endpoint supports the following filters:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * + `location` - funders located in given country
     * ## Pagination with offsets
     *
     * Offsets can be used to iterate over the results. For this route, the maximum number of available results is 80,000, which in this case allows to retrieve all the indexed items. This limit applies to the sum of values of parameters `offset` + `rows`.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * The number of items returned in a single response is controlled by `rows` parameter (default is 20, and maximum is 1,000). To limit results to 5, for example, you could do the following:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /works?query=allen+renear&rows=5
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * `offset` parameter can be used to retrieve items starting from a specific index of the result list. For example, to select the second set of 5 results (i.e. results 6 through 10), you would do the following:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /works?query=allen+renear&rows=5&offset=5
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ## Deep paging
     *
     * Deep paging using cursors can be used to iterate over large result sets, without any limits on their size.
     *
     * ##
     *
     * To use deep paging make a query as normal, but include the `cursor` parameter with a value of `*`, for example:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /members/311/works?filter=type:journal-article&cursor=*
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * A `next-cursor` field will be provided in the JSON response. To get the next page of results, pass the value of `next-cursor` as the cursor parameter (remember to URL-encode). For example:
     *
     * ##
     *
     * ```
     * /members/311/works?filter=type:journal-article&cursor=<value of next-cursor parameter>
     * ```
     *
     * ##
     *
     * Clients should check the number of returned items. If the number of returned items is equal to the number of expected rows then the end of the result set has been reached. Using next-cursor beyond this point will result in responses with an empty items list.
     *
